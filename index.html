                    <h1>Hello!</h1>

                    <h2>My name is Will Altman, and I am a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at The
                        Ohio
                        State University.</h2>

                    <h3></h3>
                    <br>

                    <h3>I started programming as a Sophomore at Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, when I
                        took Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science. This course was just one of the nine AP courses
                        I took before college. Ever since, programming has become one of my deepest passions, and
                        I will always endeavor to continue learning about and perfecting my skills in this area.
                        Although coding is my passion, I have other interests and pursuits. <br><br>I’ve been playing
                        trumpet since 2010 and am fiercely competitive when it comes to the craft. One of my proudest
                        musical achievements was earning a spot, as an incoming freshmen, on The Ohio State University
                        Marching Band (OSUMB), also famously known as <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tbdbitl" target="_blank"
                            class="tbdbitl"><strong class="tooltip">TBDBITL.
                                <span class="tooltiptext">The Best Damn Band In The Land
                                </span>
                            </strong></a>

                        To make the marching band, I commuted three and a half hours, roundtrip, from Cincinnati to
                        Columbus three times a week to practice with 500 other musicians who were all vying for their
                        spot in the 228-strong ensemble. Nothing was guaranteed, however. Attending these practices only
                        prepared you for tryouts and did not merit you a spot in the band. Tryouts themselves were
                        grueling: four straight days of dawn to dusk competition in endurance-based marching exercises
                        where multiple pairs of eyes were evaluating every aspect of your technique. Consistency and
                        precision were paramount, and something as trivial as not pointing your toe enough during one
                        session was enough to get anyone cut. After it was all said and done, my hardwork and dedication
                        paid off and secured me a spot while 350 others went home empty handed. As a member of the
                        OSUMB, I’ve performed in front of crowds exceeding 100,000 spectators and have been filmed up
                        close on live, national TV broadcasts. During the football season, the band demands 30 hours a
                        week on average for learning new routines, new music, and continuing to perfect the band’s
                        trademark marching precision. All the while, I’ve successfully completed a full academic
                        engineering course load, making the Dean’s list each semester.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides music, I’m also a huge movie buff. Before the pandemic, I would normally go to the
                        theater two or three times during a month to see the best (and worst) new movies. I’ve also
                        written dozens of short essays analyzing all sorts of different aspects of classic and
                        award-winning films in the three film analysis classes I have taken throughout highschool and
                        college.

                        <br><br>I also enjoy teaching, and since August 2020, I’ve been a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the
                        Software Components course at OSU. As a TA, I grade projects and homework on behalf of the
                        professor. In addition, I help run two closed lab sessions and host several office hours every
                        week to help students succeed in their coursework. I assist them in every way I can, from
                        hosting one-on-one private tutor sessions where I walk them through an assignment to debugging
                        the trickiest code the students are asked to write throughout the semester.
